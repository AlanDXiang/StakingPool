If `token` returns no value,\n non-reverting calls are assumed to be successful.\n IMPORTANT: If the token implements ERC-7674 (ERC-20 with temporary allowance), and if the \"client\"\n smart contract uses ERC-7674 to set temporary allowances, then the \"client\" smart contract should avoid using\n this function. Performing a {safeIncreaseAllowance} or {safeDecreaseAllowance} operation on a token contract\n that has a non-zero temporary allowance (for that particular owner-spender) will result in unexpected behavior."

This can be worked around by making\n those functions `private`, and then adding `external` `nonReentrant` entry\n points to them.\n TIP: If EIP-1153 (transient storage) is available on the chain you're deploying at,\n consider using {ReentrancyGuardTransient} instead.\n TIP: If you would like to learn more about reentrancy and alternative ways\n to protect against it, check out our blog post\n https://blog.openzeppelin.com/reentrancy-after-istanbul/[Reentrancy After Istanbul]."

Inheriting from `ReentrancyGuard` will make the {nonReentrant} modifier available, which can be applied to functions to make sure there are no nested (reentrant) calls to them. Note that because there is a single `nonReentrant` guard, functions marked as `nonReentrant` may not call one another. This can be worked around by making those functions `private`, and then adding `external` `nonReentrant` entry points to them.
